nasvim
======

Very simple NAScript plugin for Vim. Supports:

+ Syntax highlighting
+ Detects `*.nas` files as NAScript files
+ Indents as tabs and keeps indentation on new lines

Installation
------------

With [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), add this to your `~/.vimrc`:

```
call vundle#begin()
Plugin 'dflat2/nasvim`
call vundle#end()
```

Then, restart Vim and run `:PluginInstall`. It should also work with other plugin managers (check the relevant manual).
